# Data Management For Researchers

As a grad student you will be building the necessary skills to succeed in your career. Managing
your data and other research projects is an integral skill to your career, but rarely taught in 
graduate curricula. Starting a research project is a daunting prospect and many of the decisions you
make will have a significant affect on the final quality of your research products.

This workshop will provide a framework to understand the decisions that need to be made during
the course of a research project. We will provide guidance on best practices and tools available
to help you more efficiently manage your research. At the end of the workshop you will 
create an initial working plan for managing your data you can use for your own research.
